{% docs speech_order_by_topic %}

The speech order by topic refers to the order in which the speech appears for any given topic.

This order can inform, for example, which is the member who raised the motion or asked the question (first speech. in the topic) and who is the member primarily responsible for responding to the matter (second speech in the topic).
