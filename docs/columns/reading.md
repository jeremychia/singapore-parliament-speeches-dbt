| 1 First  | The draft version of a piece of legislation, called a Bill, is introduced in Parliament. There is no debate and the title of the Bill is read out. The Bill is made available to MPs for them to do research and prepare comments. | Topic = 'BI'                                        |
| 2 Second | The Bill’s general merits and principles are debated before a vote is taken. If sufficient MPs support the Bill, the title of the Bill will be read out again, hence the term “Second Reading”.                                    | Topic = 'BP' and speeches references second reading |
| 3 Third  | The Bill is reported back to Parliament for review. The Bill is then voted on and passed.                                                                                                                                          | Topic = 'BP' and speeches references third reading  |
