{% docs is_supplementary_question %}

Applicable only for speeches where the topic's section is Oral Answers (OA) or Written Answers (WA).

Supplementary questions are asked by MPs immediately after the minister's response to their primary question. They serve as follow-up inquiries seeking further clarification or additional information.

If true, this is the speech which corresponds to the follow-up question(s) asked in relation to the initial response given to the primary question. One topic can have none, or more than one supplementary question.
